# Task-Manager
##Introduction:
This is a task tracker web application that allows users to create tasks, edit and delete them, view all tasks, and sort them by title, status, and due date. Users can log in by entering their name and will only see their tasks. The app allows users to access their tasks from any device as the data is stored server-side.

##Features:

1. Create a task with a title, description, status (completed, in progress, etc.), and due date.
2. Edit and delete tasks.
3. View all tasks and sort by title, status, and due date.
4. Users can log in by entering their name and will only see their tasks.
5. Access tasks from any device as data is stored server-side.

## Technologies Used:

Our Task Tracker app is built using a combination of several technologies and languages, each playing a crucial role in making the app work seamlessly. Here are the details of the technologies we used and how they helped us in building the app:

1.Django: We used the Django web framework for building the core functionality of our Task Tracker app. Django provides a robust set of tools and features for developing web applications quickly and efficiently, including built-in authentication, database ORM, and URL routing. It allowed us to build our app logic quickly and make it more scalable.
2.EC2 Instance: We hosted our Django server, PHP pages, and MySQL database in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance. EC2 provided us with a scalable computing capacity that helped us deploy and manage our app easily.
3. Amazon RDS DB: We used the Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) to store our MySQL database. RDS provides a scalable and highly available database service in the cloud, which allowed us to store our data securely and access it quickly from anywhere.
4. Python: We used the Python programming language for the backend logic of our Task Tracker app. Python is a widely used and popular programming language that provides a vast standard library, which helped us in building the app logic quickly and efficiently.
5. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building the frontend part of our Task Tracker app. HTML provides the structure of the web page, CSS adds styling to the HTML elements, and JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic functionality to the app.
6. PHP: We used PHP for building the login and registration pages of our app. PHP is a server-side scripting language that is widely used for building dynamic web pages and applications. It allowed us to build the user authentication part of our app quickly and efficiently.

Overall, the combination of these technologies and languages helped us in building a robust and scalable Task Tracker app, with seamless functionality and user experience.

## Getting Started:
To use the task tracker app, the user can clone the git repository, install the required dependencies, and run the Django server. The app can be accessed on the browser at the specified URL.

##Conclusion:
This task tracker app is a simple yet powerful tool for managing tasks. It allows users to keep track of their tasks and access them from any device. The app can be extended further by adding more features such as reminders, deadlines, and notifications.
